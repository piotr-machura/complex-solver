# AP4-project-java: Complex function solver

End-of-class project for "Object Oriented Programming" class during 4th semester of Applied Physics.

### TODO list:

1. **Winding number algorithm** needs to use phase from 0 to 2 _ k _ pi where k is current winding number. Caused by edge cases in normal methods of computing phase.
2. **Calculator GUI** needs significant polishing and `Function` window needs to be implemented. Also a function which attempts to clean up user input (and discard it if invalid) is due.
3. **Parsing functions from strings** https://github.com/sbesada/java.math.expression.parser
