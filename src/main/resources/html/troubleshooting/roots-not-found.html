    <p>If a pole ends up inside of the searching area this algorithm will pick up on it as if it were a root. We have
        ensured that a pole won't be added to the solutions, but unfortunatelly if <strong>both</strong> a pole and a
        root are present inside of one of the search areas they "cancell out", and there is nothing this algorithm can
        do to find them. We have undertaken some measures in order to prevent it as best as we can, but it is still best
        to avoid functions with poles. If all else fails, try decreasing the range in order to ensure a root and a pole
        do not appear close together.</p>
