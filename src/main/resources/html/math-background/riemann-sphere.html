    <p>In the real numbers there are two "types" of infinity - a positive one and a negative one. In the complex plane,
        instead of defining an infinity in every direction (which would be cumbersome), we say there is only <b>one</b>
        infinity and you will get to it no matter in which direction you go.
    </p>

    <p>This lends itself to a notion, that complex numbers can be thought of as situaded on a sphere, called the
        <b>Riemann sphere</b>. Notice a very important fact: a point "spinning" around infinity will be also "spinning"
        around 0. Moreover, a point traveling along a path enclosing both zero and infinity is at the same time
        traveling along a path, which has <b>no</b> zero or infinity inside (if you look at the "other slice" of the
        sphere). This is one of the main problems with the solving algorithm used in this program.</p>
