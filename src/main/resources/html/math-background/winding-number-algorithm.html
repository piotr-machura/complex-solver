    <h1 id="winding-number-algorithm">The winding number algorithm</h1>
    <p>Draw any closed shape on the complex plane. Now imagine you are a little human, walking along that shape. What
        you will notice, is that if the point 0 is <b>inside</b> of the shape you are traveling along, then making one
        full lap will cause you to make a non-zero amount of <b>turns</b> around that point. You can caluclate this by
        integrating over the shape, or (which is much easier) calculate the total <b>phase change</b>, counting the
        change in the opposite direction with an opposite sign. This is exactly what the winding number algorithm does.
    </p>

    <p>The only difference is, it doesn't choose the shape at random. It draws a sqare in the input space (see article
        "Complex functions"), which then gets <b>mapped</b> to the output space. If there is a zero inside this mapped
        shape, then there must be a point inside of the rectangle such that the function at that point evaluates to zero
        - a <b>root</b>, and roots are what we are trying to find.</p>
    <p>The algorithm then calculates the winding number (by calculating total phase change when traveling along the
        mapped rectangle). It is non-zero, that means there is a zero inside the mapped shape, so there must be a root
        inside the square. The algorithm then splits the square into four and checks each one the same way, splitting it
        into four or discarding it if the winding number is 0. It stops when the area of the square is sufficiently
        small (this is determined by the provided accuracy, see article "Accuracy options") and adds its middle to the
        list of solutions.</p>

    <p>There are problems with this algorithm, which stem from the oddities discussed in the "Riemann sphere" article.
        Mainly, if both a root and a pole of a function end up in one square, then it's winding number will evaluate to
        0 and the square will be discarded, even though there is a perfectly good root inside. The algorithm also treats
        individual poles as zeros, although it checks if the value of the function at a point <i>is actually small</i>
        before adding it to the list of solutions.</p>
