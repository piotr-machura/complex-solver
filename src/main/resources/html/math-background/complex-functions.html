    <h1 id="input-your-function">4D nature of complex functions</h1>
    <p>Complex numbers can be thought of as 2D vectors, with the real part as a horizontal component and
        the imaginary part as vertical component. This makes complex functions a special case of vector field -
        transforming a 2D space into a new, different 2D space. Graphing it the way we are used to for real functions
        would therefore require a 4D graph, which is impossible to viusalize. </p>

    <p>This program utilizes a special technique to get around this problem called domain coloring. First, we split the
        function into an input space and an output space. Output space is then colored, with its hue corresponding to
        the angle, and its brightness representing the distance from the origin. Then all the points from input space
        "jump" to output space in a way described by the function and are colored accoridng to where they land in output
        space. Then they "jump" back to where they were beforehand, keeping the color they gained sitting in the output
        space, and thus the function is graphed.</p>
